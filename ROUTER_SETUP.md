# Installing React Router

To enable proper URL navigation and detail pages, install React Router:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

After installation, the app will support:
- Individual topic URLs (e.g., /topic/abc123)
- Individual article URLs (e.g., /article/xyz789)
- User profile URLs (e.g., /user/user123)
- Category URLs (e.g., /category/programming)
- Browser back/forward navigation
- Bookmarkable pages
- SEO-friendly URLs

The routing structure is ready to be implemented in the next update.
